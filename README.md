# Large-Language-Models
## Problem Statement
Organizations store critical knowledge in unstructured documents such as PDFs. 
Searching and understanding these documents manually is time-consuming and inefficient.

## Objective
To build an LLM-powered document intelligence system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
that can accurately answer user queries based only on the content of uploaded documents.

## Scope
- Input: PDF documents
- Output: Natural language answers
- Technology: Python, LLM, Vector Database
- Users: Single user (demo)

## Limitations
- Depends on document quality
- Requires LLM API access
